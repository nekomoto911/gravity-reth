    //!
    //! Pins the load-bearing invariants of `apply_state_changes_for_block`:
    //!   - On the activation block (`transitions_at_timestamp(current, parent) == true`), zero
    //!     balance while preserving nonce and code.
    //!   - Re-applying on the same block is idempotent.
    //!   - Pre-/post-activation blocks are no-ops.
    //!   - With `nonce > 0`, the resulting account is **not** empty under EIP-161 and therefore not
    //!     pruned by state-clear (defends R5 verify).
    //!
    //! Backend: `WrapExecutor<BasicBlockExecutor<EthEvmConfig, CacheDB<EmptyDB>>>`.
    //! The serial path is sufficient because `apply_state_change` is the same
    //! channel both serial and grevm route through; the byte-equivalence
    //! invariant between the two backends is pinned by U-2 (existing) and U-6
    //! (gas-exempt twin) — see `crates/ethereum/evm/src/parallel_execute.rs`.
    //!
    //! Naming follows the acceptance matrix verbatim so a `rg` over the test
    //! names lines up with the §1.4 checklist row in the doc.
